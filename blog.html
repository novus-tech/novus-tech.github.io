          <h3 class="">Progressive Automation Sponsorship</h3>
            <p class="date"><i>March 25, 2018</i></p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0"> <br>
            Progressive Automation is a linear actuator company that has graciously accepted to sponsor us as part of our project. They have provided us with a high torque electric linear actuator, along with controllers and mounting brackets. These components are fundamental to our robot being able to successfully interact with pallets and lift products. <br>
            The progressive automation PA-13 linear actuator was a perfect fit for our system.   Not only were the power specifications ideal, the fit form of the actuator in our pallet truck made this specific actuator much more valuable.  The diameter of the actuator’s rod was the correct size to fit in the existing hole in pallet truck making it extremely easy to mate to our current structure with just a setscrew.  Further, the other side of the actuator was mounted using a high strength aluminum mount provided by progressive automation.  This mount was added attached to our base platform made out of steel to withstand extremely high reaction forces when lifting heavy weight.  In addition, the full height of the actuator was able to fit in the gap available and the four-inch stroke length was the appropriate size to lift the pallet off the ground.  Without this actuator from Progressive Automation, the construction of our robot would not have been possible. <br>
            The electrical architecture was kept simple for the linear actuator. The linear actuator was directly connected to Scorpion XXL RC Controller, a high-performance controller specially designed for the actuator. Controlled power was supplied to the actuator through a power distribution board. For power supply, a 12V 20A fused channel was used for the linear actuator, just to provide additional protection from over current. A 10AWG wire with appropriate specification to handle 20A of current was used. An overview of the architecture can be seen in the figure below. Through the use of an stm32 microprocessor, outputting PWM control signals to the Scorpion XXL, it was possible to establish an easy manner to extend and retract the linear actuator. Using this real time control board, along with a linux based microcontroller, a remote connection was established. A user was able to command from a secondary computer to lift and put down pallets as necessary. The easy to use Scorpion allowed it such that it was only necessary to send a signal during actuation, and afterwards the robot was able to continue with other actions, relying on the dependable controller and actuator to stay in it’s desired position. Further, the limit switches built into the linear actuator were used in a manner to identify maximum and minimum points. This allowed for a reliable identification of where the pallet will be when fully extended or retracted.<br>

              Starting with the basics, we wanted to ensure that our robot will not, even accidentally, bump into anything. Although our main CPU will be calculating and providing speed to our real time CPU, our real time stm32 also has integrated Time of Flight sensors. These sensors sense the surrounding direction of the robot and apply emergency braking to the motors such that our robot always stops within a safe distance.<br>

              Being able to lift a pallet is a huge leap forward for us. Using components from an existing system, there was some uncertainty about if our robot will be able to balance the required forces to push the linear actuator to lift the forks. Notice the wheels and forks extending in the back as the linear actuator pushes up. Stay tuned for our weight capacity testing soon.<br>

              Our hardware has been severely bottlenecked by a larger problem we did not expect. One of our sponsors fell through and we were unable to successfully obtain our batteries in the last two months. We decided there was no point in waiting any longer and made the investment oursevles.. because what will our robot do without a power source? We also have attached a power distribution panel that will allow us to easily manage high current motors on different channels, with individual fuses, such that nothing goes beyond its appropriate limit. There is also a 120 A limit switch that ensures the battery never exceeds an appropriate power surge.<br>

              A key component to our robot being able to navigate the warehouse automatically is through the use of its eyes - the Realsense Camera. This camera provides rgb camera data along with depth data. This allows the robot to look for objects in its field of vision, and dynamically modifty the path. <br>

              The first step toward our drive train is making sure that we steer the system. This means making sure we can accurately turn the motor to the exact position, acting like a servo. Completing this allows us to appropriately turn without having to change driving speeds.<br>

This development PCB houses both MCUs, our Intel UP autonomous algorithms, and stm32, our real time IO processing unit. This is going to be used as the central point where all inputs including power from battery, and all sensor inputs and communictions. All output signals including output controls to actuators is also through here. The PCBs have beene sent for production and all components ordered on DigiKey. <br>
